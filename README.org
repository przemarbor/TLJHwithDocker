 
* How to use this repo
This repository is intended to automate the process of installation and
configuration of TheLittlestJupyterHub service.

1. On the server of your choice (in ~ssh~?), in the directory of your choice run:
   #+begin_src bash
   git clone https://github.com/przemarbor/JupyterHub-TheLittlest-ViaDocker
   #+end_src

2. Make apropriate changes in ~Makefile~:
  - change ~adminLogin~ from default ~admin~!!!
  - if you want to build new server and test it without stopping running instance
    of the server you should additionally change variables:
    ~localDir~, ~containername~ and ~externalPort~     
  - ~dataDir~ should stay the same or you should copy the content of the ~dataDir~
  from running instance of the server to another one that is going to be tested

3. Run
   #+begin_src bash
   make initialize-project-from-scratch
   #+end_src
      
   and wait for a while.
   After some time you should have JupyterHub running at
   ~yourMachineAddress:externalPort~ (for instance ~127.0.0.1:12000~,
   ~localhost:12000~, ~62.14.11.123:12000~ or whatever...).

4. Now login for the first time as an admin and set their (:-)) password.
   Go to ~New -> Terminal~. At the command line download
   admin's configuration script by:
   #+begin_src bash
   
   #+end_src
